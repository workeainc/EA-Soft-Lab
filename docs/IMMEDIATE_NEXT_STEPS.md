# 🚀 Immediate Next Steps - Sanity CMS Setup

## Current Status: ✅ Technical Setup Complete
Your Sanity CMS integration is fully configured and ready for the final steps!

## 📋 What You Need to Do Now

### 1. 🔐 Complete Sanity Authentication
The Sanity initialization was interrupted because it needs authentication. Here's what to do:

1. **Complete the browser login** that was opened
2. **Create your Sanity account** if you don't have one
3. **Create the project** when prompted
4. **Note your Project ID** - you'll need this for the next steps

### 2. 📝 Create Environment File
Create a file called `.env.local` in your project root with this content:

```env
# Sanity CMS Configuration
PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=your-actual-project-id-here
PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=production
SANITY_API_TOKEN=your-api-token-here

# Google Analytics (optional)
GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX

# Site URL
PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://easoftlab.com
```

**Replace the placeholder values with your actual Sanity project credentials.**

### 3. ⚙️ Update Astro Configuration
Open `astro.config.mjs` and replace `'your-project-id'` with your actual Sanity project ID.

### 4. 🚀 Start Development Servers

**Terminal 1 - Start Astro:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

**Terminal 2 - Start Sanity Studio:**
```bash
npm run studio
```

### 5. 📝 Add Your First Content

1. **Go to Sanity Studio**: `http://localhost:4321/studio`
2. **Add Company Information** first (this will be used across the site)
3. **Add Team Members**
4. **Create Services**
5. **Add Portfolio Projects**
6. **Write Blog Posts**

### 6. 🔄 Update Website Pages
